# Description

In this activity, I created two classes, Sorting and Main. In the Sorting class, getArray prompts the user to enter 5 unsorted intgers and they are then added to an array. The unsorted array is then returned. sortArray takes an array of integers and sorts them using the sorting algorithm selection to sort the array. The array is then returned. The main class then creates an insstance of the sorting class, uses the getArray method and reuturns the array as a variable. The unsorted array is then printed. Using the instance from before, the sortedArray method is called and the sorted array is returned and is stored in a varible, which is then printed.

The hardest part was formating the correct variables in the selection algorithm.

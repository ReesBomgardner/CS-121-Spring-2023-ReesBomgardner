# Description

In this activity, I made a HashMap and Main class. In HashMap, methods are made that can add a key/value pair, remove a key/value pair, get the value, and display the key/value. Main creates an instnce of the HashMap and uses that instance to add 3 key/value pairs to the HashMap, displays the key/value, removes one of the key/value pairs, and displays the key/value pairs again.

The hardest part was displaying the updated key/value pairs.

# Description

In this activity, I created two classes GenericMethods and Main. In GenericMethods, I rewrote an assignment example called printArrayList to have a parameter of an ArrayList of any type and print the elements in the ArrayList. In Main, I made an instance of GenericMethods and rewrote the assignment example's arrays as 4 different types. The lists were then initialized. The instances of were then used to use the method printArrayList using every ArrayList.

The hardest part was printing every element of the ArrayLists in printArrayList.

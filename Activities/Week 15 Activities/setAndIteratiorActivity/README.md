# Description

In this activity, I created 2 classes, StudentSet and Main. In the StudentSet, a set called students is created, a method called addStudents asks the user to enter any number of students to the set, or "q" to quit. A method called displayStudents creates an iterator for the students set and iterates through the set while hasNext() is true and prints out the next student in the set. The Main method then creates an instance of the StudentSet, calls the addStudents method, and calls the displayStudeents method.

The hardest part was to add to the set and display the correct student without repetition.

# Description

In this activity, I created two classes, Student and Main. In the Student class I made the instance variables firstName, lastName, ID, major, classStanding, GPA, and courseList. The course list is a LinkedList of the students courses and usues only the names of the courses as String. The student class also uses constructors with parameters for the variables, and methods to add, remove, return a string of student info, and print the courses from courseList. The Main class, creates two intances of the student class with parameters. For earch student instance 3 classes are added to the course list. The students info is then printed, then the students course list is printed. A course is then removed and the list is reprinted

The hardest part was printing the courses from the course list.

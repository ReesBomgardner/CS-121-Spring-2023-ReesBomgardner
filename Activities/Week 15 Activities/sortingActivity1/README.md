# Description

In this activity,  I created a Sorting class and a Main class. In the Sorting class I created a method getArray that promps the user to enter 5 unsorted integers, the integers are then added to an array which is returned. The method sortArray takes the array of integers and uses bubble sorting to sort the integers from smallest to largest. The main class then creates an insstance of the sorting class, uses the getArray method and reuturns the array as a variable. The unsorted array is then printed. Using the instance from before, the sortedArray method is called and the sorted array is returned and is stored in a varible, which is then printed.

The hardest part was using the correct variables to store the arrays in to print and sort them.

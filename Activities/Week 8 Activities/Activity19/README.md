# Description

In this activity, I created a supercalss of Students that used instance variables, setters, getters, and a toString() method to get the ID, year, and name of the students. I also had two subclasses, StudentGPA and StudentMealSwipes, StudentGPA added a GPA to the students string, StudentMealSwipes added meal swipes per day to the students string. The information was then printed.

The hardest part was adding both subclasses information to the string.

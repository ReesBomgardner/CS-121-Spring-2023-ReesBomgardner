# Description

In this activity, I created two classes, Activity21 and Main. Activity21 creates 3 instance variables and 1 static varible that acts as a counter. A constructor then initializes the instance variables and increments the counter and a method that prints what the counter is up to. In the Main class, two instances were created. Both instances are called to print the return value of the counter, and then the method itself is called and prints its returned value.

The hardest part was to format the static methods correctly.

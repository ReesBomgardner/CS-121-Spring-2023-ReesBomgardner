# Description

In this activity, I created two packages, abstractClasses and interfaces. In abstractClasses,  I made 4 classes, an abstract class that made collected ID number, name, and year. Two subclasses, one that collected credit hours and produced a college year equivalence, the other collected how many meal swipes you have per day, then it calculated how much per weak you spend on meals. The results for each subclasses were then printed.

The hardest part was finding out how to format the abstract classes and integrate them.

# Description

In this activity, I created 3 seperate classes. In ArrayDemo1 and ArrayDemo2, I created two four-dimensional arrays with three elements of itegers, I then used one the two different types of declaration and initalization in ArrayDemo1 and the other set in ArrayDemo2. The array elements were then printed, ArrayDemo1 used the for each method while ArrayDemo2 used the regular for loop. In ArrayDemo3, I created a two dimensional array of strings and printed it using a for each loop.

The hardest part was connecting the correct elements in ArrayDemo3 to print what I desired.

# Description

In this activity, I created two classes, stringArrayList and classArrayList. In stringArrayList, I used the first and last names of my friends and myself to create a series of methods to add names, remove, get the size of, or print the list of names in an arrayList. In classArrayList, I created methods to add and print the arrayList of course names, gpa, score, and letter grade until the user prompted to quit by typing "q" at any point. The arrayList was then printed.

The hardest part was allowing the user to type "q" at any point and get the program end without any errors, and still printing the results.

# Description
In this project, I wrote a Pokemon battle game. The user is asked to enter an odd number of rounds. For each round, both players select a Pokemon and enter its name, hit points, move name, the moves power, and the attack speed. To determine who starts the round, the Pokemon who's attack speed is the highest attacks first. If the attack speeds are equal a random number is drawn to decide which Pokemon strikes first. The Pokemon who attacked first, gets their move's power subtracted from the other players hit points. The second Pokemon then attacks. The Pokemon then continue to takes turns until a Pokemon's hit points are zero or less. After all of the rounds are complete the final scores are printed. The player who has the highest number of round wins, win the game.

# Description

In this project I created 3 classes, The Pokemon class creates instance variables name, hitPoints, move, movePower, attackSpeed. The Pokemon class also constructs the variables, setter and getters for the instance variables, and a method that returns a Pokemon's states as a formated String. The PokemonSelection class creates an instance of a Pokemon. A method called createPokemon that uses Scanner to the varibles to create a Pokemon and returns the Pokemon object. Instance variables to create a Pokemon. A constructor that gets the information of the Pokemon class. A method called assignPokemon that is called for both players to assign Pokemon to the players, this method also prints what Pokemon the players are assigned and their stats. The main class creates an instance of the PokemonSelection and uses this instance to call assignPokemon.
This project differs from the last by using static methods, contructors, initiators, getter and setters, and doesn't enact the batte between Pokemon.
